# Class 5 Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. It offers support for several programming paradigms such as object-oriented, imperative, functional, and procedural styles. Python is often used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. It's known for its easy syntax, which makes it a great language for beginners to learn.

# Execute Python Syntax

As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:

```python
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
```

Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:

```python
C:\Users\*Your Name*>python myfile.py
```

---

# Python Comments

---

Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

---

# Creating a Comment

Comments starts with a `#`, and Python will ignore them:

# Example

[Get your own Python Server](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_server.asp)

```python
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:

# Example

```python
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```

A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

# Example

```python
#print("Hello, World!")
#print("Cheers, Mate!")
```

# Python Variables

---

# Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

---

# Creating Variables

Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

# Example

[Get your own Python Server](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_server.asp)

```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_variables1)

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular *type*, and can even change type after they have been set.

# Example

```python
x = 4       # x is of type intx = "Sally" # x is now of type strprint(x)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_variables2)

---

# Casting

If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

# Example

```python
x = str(3)    
# x will be '3'
y = int(3)    
# y will be 3
z = float(3)  
# z will be 3.0
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_variables_casting)

---

---

# Get the Type

You can get the data type of a variable with the `type()` function.

# Example

```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_variables_type)

You will learn more about [data types](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp) and [casting](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_casting.asp) later in this tutorial.

---

# Single or Double Quotes?

String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

# Example

```python
x = "John"
```

```python
# is the same as x = 'John'
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_variables7)

---

# Case-Sensitive

Variable names are case-sensitive.

# Example

This will create two variables:

```python
a = 4A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
```

# Built-in Data Types

In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

| Text Type: | str |
| --- | --- |
| Numeric Types: | int, float, complex |
| Sequence Types: | list, tuple, range |
| Mapping Type: | dict |
| Set Types: | set, frozenset |
| Boolean Type: | bool |
| Binary Types: | bytes, bytearray, memoryview |
| None Type: | NoneType |

---

# Getting the Data Type

You can get the data type of any object by using the `type()` function:

# Example

[Get your own Python Server](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_server.asp)

Print the data type of the variable x:

```python
x = 5; 
print(type(x))
```

# Python Lists

---

```python
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

---

# List

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are [Tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp), [Set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp), and [Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp), all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:

# Example

[Get your own Python Server](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_server.asp)

Create a List:

```python
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_list)

---

# List Items

List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.

---

# Ordered

When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

**Note:** There are some [list methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_methods.asp) that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.

---

# Changeable

The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

---

# Allow Duplicates

Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:

# Example

Lists allow duplicate values:

```python
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_list_duplicates)

---

---

# List Length

To determine how many items a list has, use the `len()` function:

# Example

Print the number of items in the list:

```python
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_list_len)

---

# List Items - Data Types

List items can be of any data type:

# Example

String, int and boolean data types:

```python
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]list3 = [True, False, False]
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_list_datatypes)

A list can contain different data types:

# Example

A list with strings, integers and boolean values:

```python
list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_list_datatypes2)

---

# type()

From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':

```python
<class 'list'>
```

# Example

What is the data type of a list?

```python
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(mylist))
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_list_datatypes3)

---

# The list() Constructor

It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.

# Example

Using the `list()` constructor to make a List:

```python
thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) 
# note the double round-bracketsprint(thislist)
```

# Python Tuples

[❮ Previous](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_exercises.asp)[Next ❯](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples_access.asp)

---

```python
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```

---

# Tuple

Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are [List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp), [Set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp), and [Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp), all with different qualities and usage.

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and **unchangeable**.

Tuples are written with round brackets.

# Example

[Get your own Python Server](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_server.asp)

Create a Tuple:

```python
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
```

# Tuple Items

Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.

---

# Ordered

When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

---

# Unchangeable

Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

---

# Allow Duplicates

Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:

# Example

Tuples allow duplicate values:

```python
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
```

---

# Tuple Length

To determine how many items a tuple has, use the `len()` function:

# Example

Print the number of items in the tuple:

```python
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(thistuple))
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_tuple_len)

---

# Create Tuple With One Item

To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.

# Example

One item tuple, remember the comma:

```python
thistuple = ("apple",)print(type(thistuple))
#NOT a tuplethistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))
```

```python
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```

---

# Set

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are [List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp), [Tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp), and [Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp), all with different qualities and usage.

A set is a collection which is *unordered*, *unchangeable**, and *unindexed*.

- **Note:** Set *items* are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

Sets are written with curly brackets.

# Example[Get your own Python Server](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_server.asp)

Create a Set:

```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}print(thisset)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_set)

**Note:** Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.

---

# Set Items

Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.

---

# Unordered

Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.

Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.

---

# Unchangeable

Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.

Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.

---

# Duplicates Not Allowed

Sets cannot have two items with the same value.

# Example

Duplicate values will be ignored:

```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}print(thisset)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_sets_duplicate_error)

# Dictionary

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are *ordered*. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are *unordered*.

Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

# Example

# Dictionary Items

Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.

Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

# Example

When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.

---

# Changeable

Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.

---

# Duplicates Not Allowed

Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:

# Example

Duplicate values will overwrite existing values:

# Python For Loops

[❮ Previous](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp)[Next ❯](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)

---

# Python For Loops

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

# Example

[Get your own Python Server](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_server.asp)

Print each fruit in a fruit list:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:  
print(x)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_for)

The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.

---

# Looping Through a String

Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:

# Example

Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

```python
for x in "banana":  
print(x)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_for_string)

---

# The break Statement

With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:

# Example

Exit the loop when `x` is "banana":

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:  
print(x)  
if x == "banana":    
break
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_for_break)

# Example

Exit the loop when `x` is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:  
  if x == "banana":    
    break  
  print(x)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_for_break2)

---

---

# The continue Statement

With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:

# Example

Do not print banana:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:  
  if x == "banana":    
   continue  
  print(x)
```

# The range() Function

To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,

The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

# Example

Using the range() function:

```python
for x in range(6):  
  print(x)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_for_range)

Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.

The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: range(2, 6), which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6):

# Example

Using the start parameter:

```python
for x in range(2, 6):  
print(x)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_for_range2)

The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, **3**):

# Example

Increment the sequence with 3 (default is 1):

```python
for x in range(2, 30, 3):  
  print(x)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_for_range3)

---

# Else in For Loop

The `else` keyword in a `for` loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:

# Example

Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended:

```python
for x in range(6):  
 print(x)
  else:  
     print("Finally finished!")
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_for_else)

**Note:** The `else` block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a `break` statement.

# Example

Break the loop when `x` is 3, and see what happens with the `else` block:

```python
for x in range(6):  
 if x == 3: 
   break  
 print(x)
 else:  
  print("Finally finished!")
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_for_else_break)

---

# Nested Loops

A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.

The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":

# Example

Print each adjective for every fruit:

```python
adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in adj:  
 for y in fruits:    
  print(x, y)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_for_nested)

---

# The pass Statement

`for` loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a `for` loop with no content, put in the `pass` statement to avoid getting an error.

# Example

```python
for x in [0, 1, 2]:  
  pass
```

# Python Conditions and If statements

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- Equals: a == b
- Not Equals: a != b
- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

# Example[Get your own Python Server](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_server.asp)

If statement:

```python
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:  
 print("b is greater than a")
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_if2)

In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".

# Indentation

Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

# Example

If statement, without indentation (will raise an error):

```python
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a") 
# you will get an error
```

---

# Elif

The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

# Example

```python
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:  
   print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:  
   print("a and b are equal")
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_if_elif)

In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".

---

# Else

The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

# Example

```python
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:  
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:  
  print("a and b are equal")
else:  
  print("a is greater than b")
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_if_else)

In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not true, also the elif condition is not true, so we go to the else condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".

You can also have an `else` without the `elif`:

# Example

```python
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:  
  print("b is greater than a")
else:  
  print("b is not greater than a")
```

# Short Hand If

If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.

# Example

One line if statement:

```python
if a > b: 
print("a is greater than b")
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_if_short)

---

# Short Hand If ... Else

If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:

# Example

One line if else statement:

```python
a = 2
b = 330
if a > b
  print("A") 
else 
  print("B")
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_if_else_short)

This technique is known as **Ternary Operators**, or **Conditional Expressions**.

You can also have multiple else statements on the same line:

# Example

One line if else statement, with 3 conditions:

```python
a = 330
b = 330 
if a > b
  print("A") 
else 
if a == b 
  print("=") 
else 
  print("B")
```

---

# And

The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:

# Example

Test if `a` is greater than `b`, AND if `c` is greater than `a`:

```python
a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b and c > a:  
print("Both conditions are True")
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_if_and)

---

# Or

The `or` keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:

# Example

Test if `a` is greater than `b`, OR if `a` is greater than `c`:

```python
a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b or a > c:  
print("At least one of the conditions is True")
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_if_or)

---

# Not

The `not` keyword is a logical operator, and is used to reverse the result of the conditional statement:

# Example

Test if `a` is NOT greater than `b`:

```python
a = 33
b = 200
if not a > b:  
print("a is NOT greater than b")
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_if_not)

---

# Nested If

You can have `if` statements inside `if` statements, this is called *nested* `if` statements.

# Example

```python
x = 41
if x > 10:  
    print("Above ten,")  
if x > 20:    
    print("and also above 20!")  
else:    
    print("but not above 20.")
```

---

# The pass Statement

`if` statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an `if` statement with no content, put in the `pass` statement to avoid getting an error.

# Example

```python
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:  pass
```

# Python Functions

[❮ Previous](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp)[Next ❯](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp)

---

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

A function can return data as a result.

---

# Creating a Function

In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:

# Example

[Get your own Python Server](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_server.asp)

```python
def my_function():  
print("Hello from a function")
```

---

# Calling a Function

To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:

# Example

```python
def my_function():  
   print("Hello from a function")
**my_function()**
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function)

---

# Arguments

Information can be passed into functions as arguments.

Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.

The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:

# Example

```python
def my_function(**fname**):  
  print(fname + " Refsnes")
my_function(**"Emil"**)
my_function(**"Tobias"**)
my_function(**"Linus"**)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function_param)

*Arguments* are often shortened to *args* in Python documentations.

---

---

# Parameters or Arguments?

The terms *parameter* and *argument* can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.

From a function's perspective:

A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.

An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

---

# Number of Arguments

By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.

# Example

This function expects 2 arguments, and gets 2 arguments:

```python
def my_function(fname, lname):  
  print(fname + " " + lname)
my_function("Emil", "Refsnes")
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function_args_n)

If you try to call the function with 1 or 3 arguments, you will get an error:

# Example

This function expects 2 arguments, but gets only 1:

```python
def my_function(fname, lname):  
  print(fname + " " + lname)
my_function("Emil")
```

---

# Arbitrary Arguments, *args

If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a `*` before the parameter name in the function definition.

This way the function will receive a *tuple* of arguments, and can access the items accordingly:

# Example

If the number of arguments is unknown, add a `*` before the parameter name:

```python
def my_function(*kids):  
  print("The youngest child is " + kids[2])
my_function("Emil", "Tobias", "Linus")
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function_args)

*Arbitrary Arguments* are often shortened to **args* in Python documentations.

---

# Keyword Arguments

You can also send arguments with the *key* = *value* syntax.

This way the order of the arguments does not matter.

# Example

```python
def my_function(child3, child2, child1):  
  print("The youngest child is " + child3)
my_function(child1 = "Emil", child2 = "Tobias", child3 = "Linus")
```

The phrase *Keyword Arguments* are often shortened to *kwargs* in Python documentations.

---

# Arbitrary Keyword Arguments, **kwargs

If you do not know how many keyword arguments that will be passed into your function, add two asterisk: `**` before the parameter name in the function definition.

This way the function will receive a *dictionary* of arguments, and can access the items accordingly:

# Example

If the number of keyword arguments is unknown, add a double `**` before the parameter name:

```python
def my_function(**kid):  
  print("His last name is " + kid["lname"])
my_function(fname = "Tobias", lname = "Refsnes")
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function_kwargs_n)

*Arbitrary Kword Arguments* are often shortened to ***kwargs* in Python documentations.

---

# Default Parameter Value

The following example shows how to use a default parameter value.

If we call the function without argument, it uses the default value:

# Example

```python
def my_function(**country = "Norway"**):  
  print("I am from " + country)
my_function("Sweden")
my_function("India")
my_function()
my_function("Brazil")
```

---

# Passing a List as an Argument

You can send any data types of argument to a function (string, number, list, dictionary etc.), and it will be treated as the same data type inside the function.

E.g. if you send a List as an argument, it will still be a List when it reaches the function:

# Example

```python
def my_function(food):  
  for x in food:    
      print(x)fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
my_function(fruits)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function_param3)

---

# Return Values

To let a function return a value, use the `return` statement:

# Example

```python
def my_function(x):  
  **return 5 * x**
print(my_function(3))
print(my_function(5))
print(my_function(9))
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function_return)

---

# The pass Statement

`function` definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a `function` definition with no content, put in the `pass` statement to avoid getting an error.

# Example

```python
def myfunction():  
  pass
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function_pass)

---

# Positional-Only Arguments

You can specify that a function can have ONLY positional arguments, or ONLY keyword arguments.

To specify that a function can have only positional arguments, add `, /` after the arguments:

# Example

```python
def my_function(x, /):  
  print(x)my_function(3)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function_pos_only)

Without the `, /` you are actually allowed to use keyword arguments even if the function expects positional arguments:

# Example

```python
def my_function(x):  
  print(x)
my_function(x = 3)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function_pos_only2)

But when adding the `, /` you will get an error if you try to send a keyword argument:

# Example

```python
def my_function(x, /):  
  print(x)
my_function(x = 3)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function_pos_only3)

---

# Keyword-Only Arguments

To specify that a function can have only keyword arguments, add `*,` *before* the arguments:

# Example

```python
def my_function(*, x):  
  print(x)
my_function(x = 3)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function_kwd_only)

Without the `*,` you are allowed to use positionale arguments even if the function expects keyword arguments:

# Example

```python
def my_function(x):  
  print(x)
my_function(3)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function_kwd_only2)

But when adding the `*, /` you will get an error if you try to send a positional argument:

# Example

```python
def my_function(*, x):  
  print(x)
my_function(3)
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_function_kwd_only3)

---

# Combine Positional-Only and Keyword-Only

You can combine the two argument types in the same function.

Any argument *before* the `/ ,` are positional-only, and any argument *after* the `*,` are keyword-only.

# Example

```python
def my_function(a, b, /, *, c, d):  
  print(a + b + c + d)
my_function(5, 6, c = 7, d = 8)
```

---

# Recursion

Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.

Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.

The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.

In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself ("recurse"). We use the k variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).

To a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is by testing and modifying it.

# Example

Recursion Example

```python
def tri_recursion(k):  
  if(k > 0):    
    result = k + tri_recursion(k - 1)    
     print(result)  
  else:    
      result = 0  
  return resultprint("\n\nRecursion Example Results")
tri_recursion(6)
```
